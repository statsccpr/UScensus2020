The UScensus2020 package consists of the Decennial census(Redistricting file) data at various levels and the related shape files. At present it has tables P1, p2, p3, p4,p5 and H1 data tables with more tables being added when the new census data gets released.

Data available in this package follows NAD83 CRS (can be checked using sf::st_crs())

The data is segregated using the census hierarchy and is available for the state, county, tract, block ,city and the blockgrouplevel.
